Title:
MOdel-measurement intercomparison of local plasticity

Introduction:
We quantify local plasticity in terms of effective shear strain with a spatial resolution on the order of 10 nm and over a field of view on ther order of 1mm.
The derivation of strain from displacement fields is taken after Allen et al (2004).
Smith et al 2007 made measurements at a resolution of 1 micrometer using visible light microscopy. For sub-micron resolution we require images taken from the scanning electron microscope.

Simulations:
We present here simulations of local plasticity with a spatial resolution of 100nm in Nickel-based superalloy RR1000. We do this using a CPFE model with EBSD input data for grain size and orientations at the sample surface.
