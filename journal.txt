Title:
Model-measurement intercomparison of local plasticity-induced strain distributions

Abstract:
We correlate the qualitative and quantitative distribution of strain localisation in Noi-base supperaloloy RR1000 in the spatial resolution range of 100nm.

Introduction:
We quantify local plasticity in terms of effective shear strain with a spatial resolution on the order of 10 nm and over a field of view on ther order of 1mm.
The derivation of strain from displacement fields is taken after Allen et al (2004).
Smith et al 2007 made measurements at a resolution of 1 micrometer using visible light microscopy. For sub-micron resolution we require images taken from the scanning electron microscope.

Simulations:
We present here simulations of local plasticity with a spatial resolution of 100nm in Nickel-based superalloy RR1000. We do this using a CPFE model with EBSD input data for grain size and orientations at the sample surface.
The preceeding body of work was developed by Taylor 2002.

Methodology:
We use CPFEM methods developed by XYZ after Taylor 2002 and we employ new hrdic measurements in the SEM under backscattered imaging conditions.

Results:
We find good correlation between the spatial distribution of strain when assessing simulation and hrdic data of the same spatial resolution. Here are, however, differences in the absolute values of strain.

Conclusions:
We conclude that the qualitative comparisons in strain localisation between theory and experiemnt are good but questions remain unanswered in regards to the values obtained.
